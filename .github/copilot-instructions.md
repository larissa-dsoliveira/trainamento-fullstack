# Copilot Instructions for `trainamento-fullstack`

## Overview
This project currently contains minimal content, with two empty files:
- `index.html`: Presumably intended for the main HTML structure of a web application.
- `frases.txt`: Likely intended for storing text phrases, possibly for localization, configuration, or data purposes.

## Guidelines for AI Agents

### General Project Goals
- **Purpose**: The project appears to be in its initial stages. Future development may involve creating a web application with dynamic content and possibly integrating text data from `frases.txt`.
- **Focus Areas**: Prioritize setting up a basic structure for the web application, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

### Suggested Next Steps
1. **HTML Development**:
   - Populate `index.html` with a basic HTML5 structure.
   - Include placeholders for linking CSS and JavaScript files.

2. **Text Data Integration**:
   - Define the purpose of `frases.txt` (e.g., localization, static content).
   - Create a script to read and utilize the text data dynamically.

3. **Project Organization**:
   - Establish a folder structure for assets (e.g., `css/`, `js/`, `images/`).
   - Add a `README.md` to document the project's purpose and usage.

### Conventions
- **File Naming**: Use lowercase and hyphens for file names (e.g., `main-style.css`, `app.js`).
- **Code Style**: Follow standard HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript ES6+ conventions.
- **Comments**: Document the purpose of each file and major code sections.

### Future Considerations
- **Dependencies**: If external libraries or frameworks are added, document them in a `README.md`.
- **Version Control**: Ensure all changes are committed with meaningful messages.
- **Testing**: Add basic tests for any scripts or dynamic functionality.

## Key Files and Directories
- `index.html`: Main entry point for the web application.
- `frases.txt`: Text data file, purpose to be defined.
